# yellow blog
It is a simple blog application, that features user authentication, blog post editor and infinite scroll.

It uses React on frontend and ExpressJS with MongoDB on backend.

### Why yellow?
I just like yellow color :)

### How to run it?
#### Frontend
1. Create `.env` file in `/frontend/` directory
2. Specify server url by writing inside it (replace url with backend url):   
`REACT_APP_BASE_URL=<url>`
3. Save file
4. Run: `npm run build`
